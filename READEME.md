## Overview

Throughout your job search, and your career, connecting with people and building relationships is going to be an invaluable resource. Networking can literally be defined as “interacting with other people to exchange information and develop contacts, especially to further one's career.” As you get closer to graduation, you will begin working more closely with the Career Services team to begin preparation for the job search. Part of our job is to help you become a ‘no brainer hire,’ and a big component of that is helping you to become comfortable talking to and connecting with others in the world of tech.

## Why is networking so important?

Throughout your job search, you can use the power of networking to meet industry professionals and land a job in the company you want to work for. Having personal and professional contacts is the key to career success. People are most often hired through their connections and who they know via the “grapevine.” Networking with the right people can help you get the job advice you need to succeed. Your network can also alert you to unadvertised job openings. If you have a solid network now, great! Your career coach will help you to leverage those contacts in the best way possible. Do not worry if you don’t feel you have a strong network; the goal is to build one. Your network grows, and becomes stronger by networking.

Although it is early on in your Flatiron journey, a question commonly asked is ‘What can I be doing NOW to start preparing for my career?’ The quickest and easiest answer is to start networking.  For the most part, networking can be done in two ways: electronically and in-person. In-person networking involves exploring the local tech scene in your area and locating meetups/events you are interested in attending. An incredibly helpful resource to begin your research is meetup.com.
